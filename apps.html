        </h1>
        <p>
           For my final project, my partner and I created a fun game called Space Quest. The user is able to choose from three diferent characters who each have their own background. The character is floating in space trying to collect as many "gems" as possible at the same time avoiding space rocks. Getting hit by a space rock takes away from one of your three lives. If you happen to see a heart passing by, grab it! A heart will give you a new life.  Control your character by using your mouse and hit spacebar to pause the game at anytime. Reminder, all of this has to be done in 60 seconds or the game is over. Good Luck!
